# recosinor: Enhancing Endogenous Circadian Period Estimation

[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/recosinor)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=recosinor)

## Overview

**recosinor** is a flexible R package for modeling circadian rhythms using measured core body temperature (CBT) data. It is specifically designed to enhance the estimation of endogenous circadian rhythms by removing masking effects. **recosinor** utilizes a generalized additive model (GAM), leveraging the advantages of this powerful modeling framework.

Key Features:
- Fitting a recursive cosine function to CBT data
- Estimating endogenous circadian period by removing sleep and activity effects
- Estimating homeostatic sleep drive
- Leveraging all other features of the GAM model for comprehensive analysis

## Installation

You can install the latest stable release of **recosinor** from CRAN using:

```r
install.packages("recosinor")
